				<h2>Life of Alan Turing</h2>
				<ul id="order-info">
					<li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1931-1934</strong> - Turing studied as an
						undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge, where he was
						awarded first-class honours in mathematics
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1936</strong> - Turing delivered a paper, "On
						Computable Numbers, with an Application to the
						Entscheidungsproblem," in which he presented the notion
						of a universal machine (later called the “Universal
						Turing Machine," and then the "Turing machine") capable
						of computing anything that is computable: It is
						considered the precursor to the modern computer
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1938</strong> - He obtained his PhD from the
						Department of Mathematics at Princeton. He returned to
						Cambridge, and then took a part-time position with the
						Government Code and Cypher School, a British
						code-breaking organization.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>World War II</strong> -Turing was a leading
						participant in wartime code-breaking, particularly that
						of German ciphers. He worked at Bletchley Park, the GCCS
						wartime station, where he made five major advances in
						the field of cryptanalysis, including specifying the
						bombe, an electromechanical device used to help decipher
						German Enigma encrypted signals.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Mid 1940's</strong> -Turing moved to London in
						the mid-1940s, and began working for the National
						Physical Laboratory. Among his most notable
						contributions while working at the facility, Turing led
						the design work for the Automatic Computing Engine and
						ultimately created a groundbreaking blueprint for
						store-program computers. Though a complete version of
						the ACE was never built, its concept has been used as a
						model by tech corporations worldwide for several years,
						influencing the design of the English Electric DEUCE and
						the American Bendix G-15—credited by many in the tech
						industry as the world’s first personal computer—among
						other computer models.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Late 1940's</strong> -Turing went on to hold
						high-ranking positions in the mathematics department and
						later the computing laboratory at the University of
						Manchester in the late 1940s. He first addressed the
						issue of artificial intelligence in his 1950 paper,
						"Computing machinery and intelligence," and proposed an
						experiment known as the “Turing Test”—an effort to
						create an intelligence design standard for the tech
						industry. Over the past several decades, the test has
						significantly influenced debates over artificial
						intelligence.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1952</strong> -Homosexuality was illegal in the
						United Kingdom in the early 1950s, so when Turing
						admitted to police, called to his house after a January
						1952 break-in, that he'd had a sexual relationship with
						the perpetrator, 19-year-old Arnold Murray, he was
						charged with gross indecency. Following his arrest,
						Turing was forced to choose between temporary probation
						on the condition that he receive hormonal treatment for
						libido reduction, or imprisonment. He chose the former,
						and soon underwent chemical castration through
						injections of a synthetic estrogen hormone for a year,
						which eventually rendered him impotent
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>1954</strong> - Turing died on June 7, 1954.
						Following a postmortem exam, it was determined that the
						cause of death was cyanide poisoning. The remains of an
						apple were found next to the body, though no apple parts
						were found in his stomach.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2009</strong> - Following a petition started by
						John Graham-Cumming, then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown
						released a statement on behalf of the British
						government, which posthumously apologized to Turing for
						prosecuting him as a homosexual.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2013</strong> - Queen Elizabeth II posthumously
						granted Turing a rare royal pardon almost 60 years after
						he committed suicide
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2016</strong> - The British government announced
						“Turing’s Law” to posthumously pardon thousands of gay
						and bisexual men who were convicted for homosexual acts
						when it was considered a crime. According to a statement
						issued by Justice Minister Sam Gyimah, the law also
						automatically pardons living people who were “convicted
						of historical sexual offenses who would be innocent of
						any crime today.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>2019</strong> - the Bank of England announced
						that Turing would appear on the UK's new £50 note, along
						with images of his work. The famed scientist was chosen
						from a list of nearly 1,000 candidates nominated by the
						general public, including theoretical physicist Stephen
						Hawking and mathematician Ada Lovelace.
